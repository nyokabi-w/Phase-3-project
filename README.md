Project Overview

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is facing challenges with customer churn. Churn refers to customers terminating their subscription with the company. The objective of this project is to build a classifier that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn in the near future. By identifying predictable patterns and high-risk customers, SyriaTel aims to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce the financial loss caused by customer churn. By implementing an effective churn prediction model, SyriaTel can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, optimize marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce financial losses associated with customer churn.

Business Problem
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is facing challenges with customer churn. Churn refers to customers who terminate their subscription with the company. This impacts SyriaTel financially, acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, SyriaTel wants to build a classifier that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn in the near future. By identifying predictable patterns, SyriaTel aims to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce the financial loss caused by customer churn.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can effectively classify customers as churn or non-churn based on their historical data and behavioral patterns. By achieving this objective, SyriaTel can take targeted retention actions and implement customer-centric strategies to reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.

Data Understanding
In data understanding we want to thoroughly understand the data. this is by identifying any issues, and exploring relationships within the dataset. We can gain insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn. Understanding the data will guide us in building an effective classifier to predict customer churn and enable SyriaTel to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Modeling
The models used were this and that with the results as this and that

Evaluation
We use this and this model had the best performance when compared to the rest as well as this results.

It had a score of (x) when scoring using precision, recall, f1 score, accuracy as well as roc/auc, 
 etc

We can also observe that this other model does poorly because of this and that eg the assumptions or the hyper-parameters etc

The visualization of x and y showed A and B relationship between them

The variable results mean X and Y

CONCLUSION
In summary, customer churn poses a significant challenge for businesses of all sizes. However, by implementing the aforementioned strategies, companies like SyriaTel can effectively mitigate customer churn. These strategies involve leveraging a predictive model to identify at-risk customers, engaging them through personalized incentives and improved customer service, enhancing product offerings, gaining deeper insights into customer needs and preferences, fostering strong customer relationships, streamlining the customer experience, and actively listening to customer feedback. By adopting these measures, SyriaTel can successfully reduce customer churn, leading to enhanced profitability and greater customer satisfaction.
